            A quiet engine is a happy engine. If you start hearing noises under the hood, it may be time for an oil change. On average, you need an oil and oil filter change every 5,000-10,000 miles. Changing the oil on a regular basis is the best way to ensure that all of the parts that make your car go will keep working efficiently so you can extend the life of your vehicle.
            <br /><br />
            Why are oil changes so important? Oil lubricates your engine to keep it protected from harmful friction. It also cleans out the carbon and varnish buildup around the pistons, rings, and cylinder walls. As oil ages, it breaks down, flows less freely, and loses its lubricating and cleansing capabilities. Switch out the old oil for the new to keep your engine protected.
